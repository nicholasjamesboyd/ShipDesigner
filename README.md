# ShipDesigner
This project is a calculator to solve the algorithm for selecting an ideal concept design for OSVs

Enter parameters at the top of the ShipDesigners.py and CostCalculator.py files to specify the exact requirements for a specific operation

Run the code and download the corresponding csv file for a sorted table of the most efficient fleet design

This code is the implementation of the algorithm and equations described in the Master's Thesis "Concept Design Optimization of OSVs for Operation 
on the Flemish Pass Basin" by Nicholas Boyd
